description: This notebook explores a dataset of taxi trips in New York City. Data visualisation is used to display insights, and an ensemble model is created using LightGBM and scikit-learn which predicts the fare paid for trips it has not seen. This model reduces loss, measured by root mean square error, by 70% relative to naive estimation of the mean fare.
